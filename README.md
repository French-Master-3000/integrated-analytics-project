# Integrated Analytics Project – Superstore Analysis

## Description
This project is a comprehensive analytics assignment for college, using the Superstore dataset. It demonstrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, statistical testing, machine learning, and portfolio optimization in Python.

## How to Use
- Open the Jupyter notebook (`integrated_project.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code.
- Run the cells in order to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Project Structure
- `integrated_project.ipynb` – Main notebook with all analysis steps
- `Sample - Superstore.xlsx` – Dataset used (not included if private)
- Other supporting files (if any)

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Highlights
- Data cleaning and merging
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Feature engineering for better insights
- Statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, chi-square)
- Machine learning models (classification & regression)
- Portfolio optimization and time series forecasting
